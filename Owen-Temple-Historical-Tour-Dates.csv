You don't have to be a songwriter to attend the workshop to learn Owen's approach to writing songs.&nbsp; The registration form is attached. You can pre-pay the workshop fee via paypal at: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/songwriting-workshop-with-owen-temple-tickets-15184976674?ref=ebtn   Once upon a time, men and women would feel an urge to express something in song.&nbsp;They would sit down with a guitar and a piece of paper, and few words might emerge from the lips or on the page.  But then nothing else would happen. The idea just sat there and failed to grow into a song.  Or even worse, maybe the page was blank to begin with, and it stayed blank.  But then one day, they started Songfarming.  <a href=""http://www.songfarmer.com"" target=""_blank"">Songfarmer</a> is a process oriented approach to writing songs, and Songfarmer is a series of habits, principles, techniques, and, ideally, a community of folks working together. It’s about taking the long view on writing songs: to develop the ongoing routines of songwriting so that you get songs today, tomorrow, and on into the future.  A farmer doesn’t walk outside one day and just expect crops to burst forth from the ground, without daily preparation and steady application of habits, and songwriters should similarly collect “seeds” for songs, review them, work them gently until they grow.  The farmer and songwriter both have principles and practices that come in handy in the day to day work. And the songwriter and the farmer both need patience to encounter frustrations as they stubbornly persist in the habits of growing things.  At this songwriting workshop, Owen Temple talk about the Songfarming principles and what he has seen work for growing more and better songs.  Cost:&nbsp; $45  For information and reservations, email lydacomusic@gmail.com","1600 West Broadway, Columbia, MO",
